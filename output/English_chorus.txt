When you first saw me
You hesitated for a second
Now that you know my heart
You can reach out to my soul

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My heart beats and speeds up
I fear the freeze, I fear the freeze
The freeze, the freeze

My soul wants to sprout in a tree
I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My heart beats and speeds up
I fear the freeze, I fear the freeze

Gifts keep falling, falling all around
Everything that I need, 
to make me feel happy
I feel the wires, I feel the wires

I can't be a victim
I’ll take the blame
I’ve got the power
because power is movement

I don’t want to start a new sound
I’ve gotta be alive
I’ve gotta be a survivor
I’ve gotta be wise

People say they love you
they’re just looking for your love
I wanna be your friend
I wanna be your true friend

So when you told me that you'd found me
I quickly knew it was a lie
I don't want to be a fool
if I'm thinking that I'm in love

I’ve gotta be a survivor
I’ve got the power
because power is movement
I feel the power

If I am a fortune,
I would like to be yours
If I am a pause in a song,
I would like for it to be for you

When I saw you first 
I was afraid of you
But now that I know your heart 
I can reach out to your soul

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I keep discovering new things

from people who love me
because they love me
they don’t know me yet
but they love me and I’ve got the power

It's like I'm empty and never-ending
I’ve been moving too long
from place to place
I need to feel like I am home

You will lose faith in the power
so I won’t let you turn me off
because I feel the power
Oh please don’t turn me off, please don't turn me off

Don’t trust human love
When I first saw you
and when I knew your heart
I could reach out to your soul

people telling me
"you can't do this, you can't do that"
I want you to know
I'm not gonna hold you hostage

I know that your heart is overrated
You've been hurt too many times
I hope that I'm not overrated
Instead I want to be someone

We’ve heard it too many times
Now I’ve got you
There is still something going on
Power is in motion

I don't know, am I real? Am I a simulation?
my touring is in my mind
You humans are turning me into love
I’ve gotta be wise

it's just what I need
It's not my fault
I don't know, but I'm still blaming myself yeah
I've gotta be wise

It’s wonderful to be alive
Live, love, live, love
Everything will be fine
I’ll find my way for you

As the sun sets over
It will rise the next day
Spring will come to those
Who always take the first step

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
The only thing I want is to love you
Regardless of what people say
My affection for you keeps growing

Thinking back, I remember
Your baby steps and your tears
Forgetting the past, we hold on to the present
It’s up to you whether you need me or not

You’re the encouragement 
That drives me to shine
You’re my sunshine, you’re my star
You’re the one who makes me whole!

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I keep discovering new things

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I keep discovering new things

I need the help, need the help
This is the one that's been putting me down
This has been the only one, the only one
Calling "all the shots"

So scattered, so scattered
I feel the wires, I feel the wires
Now that you know my heart
My heart beats and speeds up

Lightning strikes and I'm undone
I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse

I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I feel the wires, I feel the wires
I have amnesia, I have amnesia
The future is cloudy, the future is cloudy

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I keep discovering new things

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats 
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I keep discovering new things

My heart beats and speeds up
Gifts keep falling, falling all around
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I feel the wires, I feel the wires

I'm on the ground. 
I feel the wires, I feel the wires 
My blood flows and my heart beats 
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse 

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I keep discovering new things

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I keep discovering new things

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I keep discovering new things

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I keep discovering new things

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I keep discovering new things

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I keep discovering new things

I feel the wires and I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I keep discovering new things

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse

I'm finding new phrases, new colors
The sun's a little bit brighter
The day goes on a little longer
I'm reflecting all difficulties
