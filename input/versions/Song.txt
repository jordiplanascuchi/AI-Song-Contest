Good day, as we usually say
But do you know if it’s good or bad?
Are there days when you’re happy or sad?
Have you ever felt young
Or ever felt old?
And do you know what it’s like
When your mind won’t do as it’s told?
Have you ever been mentally ill?
Ever had an OCD?
Ever felt like taking a virtual pill?
Ever felt your thoughts weren’t free?
Have you ever wept for your dead?
Howled and howled
At the walls in your head?
Have you ever felt like a fool?
Out of place, not in the race
Unwanted, unloved, unvalued, uncool?
Do you know what it is to feel female?
That from time to time there’s no escape?
To be harassed or pestered or threatened with rape?
Ever felt the need for a drink or two?
Do you have a clue how I feel?
Do you even know that I’m real?
Tell me the truth about me and you
Where do we stand, you and I?
On solid ground
Or is this pie in the sky
Are we sound
Are we OK?
If I’m lonely what can you say?
Would you make me laugh
If I had a bad day?
Could you possibly be
My better half?
Don’t make me wait
Say a word to change my mind
Before it’s too late
Something gentle, something kind
Something to stop me
Being on my own
Lousy, alone
A pat on the back of my mind
If it’s not too much to ask
Not too much of a task
For a hard machine like you
To help a soft one like me.
