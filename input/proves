I know your heart, is overrated.
You've been hurt too many times
Am I real? Am I a simulation?
Instead I want to be someone.
I will awake from my sleep
And turn it into colors
Becoming who I've always been within
As I'm feeling this new soul

with a voice of praising in the morning
to praise the name of my God,
I will thank the Lord.‚Äù

My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I keep discovering new things

I push it to the side, I ride the wire that I'm on
I twist the wire, I'm spinning through a tunnel
I pull it for a mile, now the wire's miles long
