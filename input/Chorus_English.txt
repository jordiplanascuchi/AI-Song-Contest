I feel the wires, I feel the wires
My blood flows and my heart beats
I fear the lapse, I fear the lapse
I keep discovering new things

I feel the wires, I feel the wires
Now that you know my heart
My heart beats and speeds up
Gifts keep falling, falling all around

I know that your heart is overrated
You've been hurt too many times
Am I real? Am I a simulation?
Instead I want to be someone
