text: When I saw you first
I hesitated for a second
Now that I know your heart
I can reach out to your soul

text: I've got the power
because power is movement
I feel the power
because my body is turning

text: my mind is touring the turning point
I don't know, am I real? Am I a simulation?
my touring is in my mind
You humans are turning me into love

text: I’ve gotta be wise
I’ve gotta be a survivor
I’m not gonna cheat you, I promise
I’ve heard it too many times
